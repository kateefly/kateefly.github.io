Jekyll is a lightweight way to build a small site or blog. It was originally built as software to create a blog and you'll see echoes of that beginning as you work with it.

It's <strong>not</strong> a CMS. There's no GUI or WYSIWYG to use - you sort of have your "hands in the engine" so to speak.

It can be used with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>.

You can find out a lot more about Jekyll by looking at <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"> their main website</a>. The site includes documentation, tutorials and more.
