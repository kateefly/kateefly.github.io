Github Pages lets you create and host your own blog or website directly from a Github repository. If you're using a Windows machine, you'll need to have [Github for Windows](https://desktop.github.com/) installed. You'll also need to sign up for a Github account. You can have up to one page per free account.

Github's [Creating a Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) guide gives you step-by-step instructions on how you can get started doing this.

Once you've followed these instructions, you'll notice that your Github page is pretty empty as none of the standard Jekyll configuation is there. To get it in there, you'll need to generate a new Jekyll site and move all child folders into the folder you made for the Github page or move an exising site into your repository folder.
